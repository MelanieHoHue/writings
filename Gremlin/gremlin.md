# Gremlin
- Name for the query language TinkerPop provides (as well as the name for the graph traversal)
- can be used at any Apache TinkerPop enabled graph store
- fairly imperative with some declarative concepts as well

The Gremlin query language is used to travers a graph, with the intention to find objects, values, relationships and patterns.
And also to create or delete vertices and edges.

> For this reason **graph queries are often referred to as traversals**, because the chaining of query steps result in a travel (from the source vertex) along the graphÂ´s objects (nodes and relations / vertices and edges) to answer the question that has been asked within in the query.
